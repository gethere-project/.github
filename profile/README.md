Public transport. Better with open source.

The gethere project aims to make it easier to get around a city by public transport. We want to achieve this using modern, fast and easy to use web and mobile app, realtime transit data, multi-modal trip planning, offline functionality and many more. All of this with a power of open source. We also provide public transport data from selected cities, but also a server that hosts an API and other useful tools. Our project allows you to save time and stress when trying to get somewhere using public transport and gives tools for developers to build something that rely on public transport data.

We love open source. ðŸ’—
